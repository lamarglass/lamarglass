I’m a self-taught AI engineer passionate about exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence and its real-world applications. My main focus is on machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, and I enjoy experimenting with different tools and frameworks such as Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I’m continuously learning and currently diving deeper into reinforcement learning, efficient fine-tuning of large language models, and building AI systems that can scale. My goal is to keep growing as an engineer, contribute to open-source, and share my journey as I build meaningful projects in the AI space.
